		<p>Jillian Rose Banks, performing simply as Banks (which is stylized as BANKS), was born on June 16, 1988, in Orange County, California. Shortly after her family moved to Los Angeles. In her teens she taught herself how to play the piano and started writing songs at the age of 15. She used her music to help her cope through her parents' divorce at the time. Later on, she earned a Bachelor's degree in psychology at the University of Southern California.</p>

		<p>During her time in college, Banks kept up a private SoundCloud page of her music. She was eventually connected British label Good Year Recordings. One of Banks' songs, "Before I Ever Met You," was played on BBC Radio 1 by February 2013 after she had posted it to her SoundCloud. In March 2013, Banks released her EP <i>Fall Over</i>, internationally, and in September 2013 she released her second EP <i>London</i>. Both EP's received extremely positive reviews by critics.</p>

		<p>In late 2013, Banks was nominated for awards from BBC and MTV. iTunes added her to the list of "New Artists for 2014." Banks was also named Artist of the Week for <i>Vogue</i> in August 2013. Several other social media outlets pointed her out as an artist to watch in 2014.</p>

		<p>Banks was the opening act for The Weeknd during his fall 2013 tour, which covered the United States and the United Kingdom. She embarked on her own tour starting in the UK starting in March 2014. In April 2014 she was a featured performer at Cochella festival, and in July 2014 she was featured at Open'er Festival. She was also part of St. Jerome's Festival which toured during 2015. Banks has also performed on <i>Jimmmy Kimmel Live!</i> on August 7, 2015.</p>

		<p>Banks' music style is described as dark R&B and is frequently compared to Ellie Gouldine, The Weeknd, and Aaliyah. However, Banks cites Lauryn Hill and Fiona Apple as her biggest influences. Banks' voice has also been noted as reminicent of Feist and Erykah Badu.</p>
